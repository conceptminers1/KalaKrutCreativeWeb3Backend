# Web3 Integration Strategic Plan (Track 2)

This document outlines the strategy for transitioning the application from a high-fidelity prototype to a live, decentralized platform with real Web3 functionality. This plan is designed to be executed in parallel with the final stabilization of the core application.

## Primary Objective

To provide a secure, robust, and compelling demonstration of the platform's Web3 capabilities for investors and early users by integrating with a live blockchain testnet.

## Key Development Tracks

### Track 1: Stabilize the Core Application

- **Status:** In Progress / Nearing Completion
- **Description:** Finalize and test the core user experience, including UI/UX, registration flows, and other non-blockchain features. A polished and bug-free front-end is essential before integrating live Web3 components.
- **Action Item:** Complete the `App.tsx` update to stabilize the registration and profile update functionality.

### Track 2: Begin Live Web3 Integration on a Testnet

- **Status:** Pending
- **Description:** This track involves building the real Web3 functionality. The goal is to create a fully functional version of the application on a public testnet (e.g., Sepolia). A live testnet demonstration is a powerful tool for proving the concept's viability to investors.
- **Key Steps:**
  1.  **Smart Contract Development & Deployment:**
      - Write, audit, and test the Solidity smart contracts for:
        - The KALA utility token.
        - DAO governance (proposals, voting).
        - NFT minting and ownership.
      - Deploy these contracts to a public Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia).

  2.  **Web3 Library Integration:**
      - Integrate a robust Web3 library like `ethers.js` or `web3.js` into the React application to enable communication with the blockchain.

  3.  **Implement a Real Wallet Connector:**
      - Replace the current mock `WalletProvider` with a production-ready solution.
      - Implement functionality to connect with user wallets like MetaMask and WalletConnect.
      - Securely handle wallet connections and retrieve the user's public address.

  4.  **Connect Frontend to Smart Contracts:**
      - Update the frontend components to call functions on the deployed smart contracts.
      - For example, the DAO Governance UI should trigger real transactions that users must sign with their wallets.

  5.  **Fetch Live On-Chain Data:**
      - Replace all mock data (e.g., `MOCK_USERS_BY_ROLE`, hardcoded wallet addresses, dummy balances) with live data fetched directly from the blockchain.
      - This includes token balances, transaction history, DAO proposal status, and NFT ownership.

## Recommendation

Proceed with the `App.tsx` update to complete Track 1. Immediately upon completion, begin Track 2 to demonstrate tangible progress on the Web3 front for investors and prepare for a successful launch.
