# Comprehensive Troubleshooting & Resolution Summary

This document provides a detailed log of all fixes and corrections implemented to restore the application to a functional state, addressing build errors, runtime crashes, and component-level bugs.

## 1. Critical Runtime Crash: The "Blank Screen" Error

The most severe issue was a runtime crash that resulted in a blank white screen, even when the dev server was running.

- **Root Cause**: The custom hook `useData()` was being called by multiple components (`App.tsx`, `Home.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`) but was **not defined or exported** anywhere in the codebase. Specifically, the `src/contexts/DataContext.tsx` file, which defined the `DataProvider`, was missing the corresponding `useData` hook implementation.
- **Resolution**:
  1.  The `useData` custom hook was implemented within `src/contexts/DataContext.tsx`. This hook correctly uses `useContext(DataContext)` and throws an error if used outside the provider, as is standard practice.
  2.  The `useData` hook was then properly exported from this file.

## 2. Build Errors & Code Standardization

Several issues were preventing the application from building successfully.

- **Incorrect Import Paths**:
  - **Problem**: `App.tsx`, `Home.tsx`, and `Layout.tsx` were all attempting to import `useData` from incorrect or non-existent paths (e.g., `./hooks/useData`).
  - **Solution**: All import statements for `useData` were corrected to point to the single source of truth: `src/contexts/DataContext.tsx`.

- **Invalid Enum Value**:
  - **Problem**: In `src/components/Home.tsx`, a `LoginCard` was using `UserRole.DAO_Governor`, which caused a TypeScript error because the enum in `src/types.ts` defines it as `UserRole.DAO_GOVERNOR`.
  - **Solution**: The value was corrected to `UserRole.DAO_GOVERNOR` to match the enum definition.

- **Dangling File Reference**:
  - **Problem**: The codebase contained references to a non-existent file at `src/hooks/useData.ts`.
  - **Solution**: After confirming the file was unnecessary and did not exist, all attempts to reference it were removed, and the correct import path was used instead.

## 3. Component-Level Bug Fixes

Beyond the build-breaking issues, several interactive components were not functioning as intended.

- **`ArtistProfile.tsx` - "Add to Leads" Button**:
  - **Problem**: The "Add to Leads" button was visible but was not wired to any function, making it un-clickable and non-functional.
  - **Solution**: The button's `onClick` event handler was correctly implemented to call the `onAddLead(artist)` function passed down through props, making the feature work as expected.

- **`ArtistProfile.tsx` - "Book Now" Button**:
  - **Problem**: The "Book Now" button was incorrectly trying to call a local `navigate` function, which was not appropriate for its context. It was meant to trigger a function passed by its parent.
  - **Solution**: The `onClick` handler was changed to call the `onBook` prop, properly connecting it to the parent component's navigation logic.

- **`App.tsx` - Wallet Connection Flow**:
  - **Problem**: The "Connect Wallet" button and the associated login logic were failing to execute due to the critical `useData` crash. While the button's code was mostly correct, the underlying system was broken.
  - **Solution**: By fixing the `useData` crash, the `handleWalletConnect` and `handleLogin` functions in `App.tsx` became operational, allowing the wallet connection and Web3 login flow to execute correctly.

This comprehensive summary accurately reflects the steps taken to diagnose and resolve the multiple layers of issues within the application.
