    content: `• Complete your Profile: Go to the 'Settings' tab. Upload a high-quality cover image and avatar.
• Get Verified: Ensure you fill out the 'Roster Registration' form found in the Dashboard. Verified users get 2x more visibility.
• Wallets: You can connect a Crypto Wallet (MetaMask) or add a Bank Card. You need at least one to receive payments.`,
  },
  {
    title: '2. How to Book & Get Paid (Artists)',
    content: `• Sending a Proposal: Go to the 'Booking Hub'. Select an artist or venue. Fill in the budget and dates.
• Escrow: When you book someone, money is held safely in 'Escrow'. It is not paid to the artist until the job is done.
• Milestones: For big projects, use 'Milestone Payments'. Example: Pay 50% deposit, and 50% after the show.
• Releasing Funds: Once the gig is over, go to 'My Proposals' and click 'Release Funds'.`,
  },
  {
    title: '3. Using the Marketplace',
    content: `• Buying: You can buy physical items (like guitars) or Digital Collectibles (NFTs).
• Selling: Click 'Sell' on the dashboard. Upload a photo, set a price (USD or Crypto), and publish.
• Auctions: You can set a timer. The highest bidder wins when time runs out.`,
  },
  {
    title: '4. Creative Studio (Uploads)',
    content: `• Uploading: Drag and drop your songs or videos into the 'Creative Studio'.
• IPFS: We store your files on the 'InterPlanetary File System'. This means no one can delete them but you.
• Minting: You can turn your uploaded song into an NFT. This proves you own it.`,
  },
  {
    title: '5. Safety & Support',
    content: `• Chat: Only chat inside the portal. If someone asks to pay via WhatsApp or Venmo, they might be a scammer.
• Disputes: If a gig goes wrong, do not release funds. Go to the 'Support Widget' (bottom right) and open a ticket.
• Tiers: Priority members get 24hr support response times.`,
  },
  {
    title: '6. Role-Specific Tips',
    content: `• Venues: Use the 'Services Hub' to find certified Lead Generation tools to fill your calendar.
• Sponsors: Check the 'DAO Governance' tab to vote on which artists receive community grants.
• Revellers: Subscribe to the 'Community Pro' plan to see full contact details of your favorite artists and get early access to tickets.`,
  },
  {
    title: '7. Community Guidelines & Legal Terms',
    content: `• What We Can't Do: KalaKrut is a technology facilitator, not a judicial body. We cannot manage or fund litigation arising from copyright violations between users. IP disputes must be resolved legally between the parties involved.
• Platform Neutrality: We operate with strict neutrality. We do not practice favoritism; visibility on the platform (Leaderboards, Search) is purely algorithmic based on user activity and XP. We cannot manually boost profiles upon request.
• Third-Party Risks: The platform is not liable for third-party thefts of data (via external phishing), theft of physical products during shipping, or unauthorized scraping of public profile data.
• Content Ownership: You retain 100% ownership of your uploads, but you also bear 100% responsibility. Uploading content you do not own will result in immediate account suspension.
• Account Deletion: As per community guidelines, you cannot self-delete active accounts to prevent fraud. Please contact an admin.`,
  },
  {
    title: '8. ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY (IMPORTANT)',
    content: `• Strict Moderation: We enforce a global algorithm to detect "illicit" or foul content/language across all formats (text, image, audio, video, NFTs, metaverse).
• Immediate Blocking: A single violation of this policy—whether in Chat, Uploads, Forums, or Registration—will trigger an immediate automated block of your account.
• No Exceptions: This applies to foul words, hate speech, illegal content, and scams.
• Appeals: If you believe you were blocked in error, you may file a formal appeal via the Support Widget, but access will remain restricted until reviewed.`,
